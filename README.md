# MSc end of year project - built an analytical tool to explore efficiency/effectiveness trade-offs in popular recommender systems

I was on the fence about uploading this one as, after looking through it, I could build it alot better now. I was teaching myself python while working on it, 
as my course was almost exclusively java. 

Thought I'd put it up anyway to show I have experience with analytical & ML libraries, as well as with working on a heavy number-crunchy application
